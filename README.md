# Python-Project-Instacart

About:
- Instacart, an online grocery store, has great sales in the United States. They plan to uncover more info about their sales patterns.

- My task is to analyze the sales data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies to further improve profitability.

<br>Data:
- The Customers Data Set, which contains users' names, age, income, etc., was created by CareerFoundry Data Analytics Bootcamp for learning purposes only. If my analysis is used publicly, customer names can instead be replaced by using their user ID number for privacy.

- The Instacart Data Set and Data Dictionary used were from Kaggle “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-201 on March 2024.

Tools used:
